# Bobs_scripts
This repository contains some useful shell scripts I wrote for practice when I was learning shell scripting. 
It  contains scripts for :
Making files
Compiling and running c code 
Performing some git instructions.
 
Making files
This has a script called maker.sh. It takes string inputs from the user(name of the file) & allows the user 
Choose from a list of file extensions for (.sh[shell script], .c[C file] .h[Header file for C] . Py[Python file]) as the file extension. It creates & runs the file with a basic print statement.
 
Compiling and running C code
This has a script called gcc.sh. It simply complies and runs your .c file as  your“file_name”.exe provided your gcc compiler is installed on your pc.
 
Performing some git instructions.
This has a script called gitbanku.sh it allows one to perform 4 basic git actions ( git_clone, git_config, git[add, commit  & push] …etc). The user must provide the necessary credential the functions demand in order to perform its tasks.
